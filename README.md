Class Summary Chapter - 05 Let's Get Hooked 
Chapter-05 was the continuation of previous chapter where we started to develop a food delivery app. In this chapter, we re-organised the repo structure, understood the importance of clean coding principles, different ways of exporting and importing modules(components). Then, the hero of this chapter Hooks got everyone hooked to their screen. It was indeed a 3 hours knowledge heavy session where foundation of hooks was laid. We used hooks to filter the restaurants based on search input. Find my version of detailed explanation of these concepts in theory-assignment.md.

After today's session, got a better understanding of Thinking in React. In last chapter, I mentioned about thinking in React and developing the app. I continued that in this chapter as well. Check coding-assignment.md to find its details.

One line about this chapter : `Hook is just normal function which manages the local variable(state), which can only be modified using it's function useState() to create a state and assign a initial value and setState() to update the state.`
